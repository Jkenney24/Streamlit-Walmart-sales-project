# Streamlit-Walmart-sales-project
This is a project I created from a database taken from Kaggle.
I put myself in the mindset of a vested manager or co-owner of the stores in the dataframe and extracted what I thought would be useful to present to partners or shareholders.
The dataframe consists of 45 stores over a 3 year period, I created an interactive revenue dashboard for the 45 store "region" for different revenue statistics.
